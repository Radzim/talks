\notes{We’re now in a new phase of the development of computing, with rapid
advances in machine learning. But we see some of the same issues –
researchers across disciplines hope to make use of machine learning,
but need access to skills and tools to do so, while the field
machine learning itself will need to develop new methods to tackle
some complex, ‘real world’ problems.}

\notes{It is with these challenges in mind that the Computer Lab has
started the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. This new
Programme is seeking to support researchers across the University to
develop the skills they need to be able to use machine learning and
AI in their research.}

\notes{To do this, the Programme is developing three areas of activity:}

\notes{* Research: we’re developing a research agenda that develops
and applies cutting edge machine learning methods to scientific
challenges, with four Accelerate Research fellows working directly on
issues relating to computational biology, psychiatry, string theory
and materials science. While we’re concentrating on STEM subjects for
now, in the longer term our ambition is to build links with the social
sciences and humanities.}

\notes{* Teaching and learning: building on the teaching activities
already delivered through University courses, we’re creating a
pipeline of learning opportunities to help PhD students and
postdocs better understand how to use data science and machine
learning in their work. Our programme with Spark is one element
of this, and we’ll be announcing further activities soon.}

\notes{* Engagement: we hope that Accelerate will help build a community
of researchers working across the University at the interface on
machine learning and the sciences, helping to share best
practice and new methods, and support each other in advancing
their research. Over the coming years, we’ll be running a
variety of events and activities in support of this, and would
welcome your ideas about what might be most useful.}
